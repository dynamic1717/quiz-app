### Ð¡reate quizzes for other users and try to answer their quizzes!

In this app you can create quizzes with your own questions and options of answers and upload them to the MongoDB database. 

The random quiz page selects a random quiz from the database. When you answer a question, the correctness of the chosen option is checked. If the answer is not correct, it is possible to retake the quiz. A new quiz can be retrieved at any time. It is possible for any user to report the quiz in case the content is questionable or an error is found in the quiz. The administrator can view report information in the database.
